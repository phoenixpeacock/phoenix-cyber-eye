                <h2>Morris Worm (1988)</h2>
                <p>  <p>The Morris worm or Internet worm of November 2, 1988, is one of the oldest computer worms distributed via the Internet, and the first to gain significant mainstream media attention. It resulted in the first felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It was written by a graduate student at Cornell University, Robert Tappan Morris, and launched on 8:30 p.m. November 2, 1988, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology network.</p>
                <p>The Morris Worm did not delete files or steal data, but it severely slowed down systems, clogging networks with replicated copies of itself. This incident highlighted the potential dangers of networked systems and led to the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), an organization established to respond to future cyber threats. It also brought cybersecurity into public awareness, marking the beginning of the field's growth into a critical area of research and development.</p</p>

                <h2>Melissa Virus (1999)</h2>
                <p>    <p>The Melissa virus is a mass-mailing macro virus released on or around March 26, 1999 by David L. Smith. It targets Microsoft Word and Outlook-based systems and created considerable network traffic. The virus infects computers via email; the email is titled "Important Message From," followed by the current username. Upon clicking the message, the body reads, "Here's that document you asked for. Don't show anyone else ;)." Attached is a Word document titled "list.doc," containing a list of pornographic sites and accompanying logins for each. It then mass-mails itself to the first fifty people in the user's contact list and disables multiple safeguard features on Microsoft Word and Microsoft Outlook.</p>
                <p>The virus slowed down email systems due to overloading Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange servers with emails. Major organizations impacted included Microsoft, Intel Corp, and the United States Marine Corps. The Computer Emergency Response Team, a Pentagon-financed security service at Carnegie Mellon University, reported 250 organizations called regarding the virus, indicating at least 100,000 workplace computers were infected, although the number is believed to be higher. An estimated one million email accounts were hijacked by the virus. The virus was able to be contained within a few days, although it took longer to remove it from infected systems entirely. At the time, it was the fastest spreading email worm.</p></p>

                <h2>Love-Letter Attack (2000)</h2>
                <p> <p>ILOVEYOU, sometimes referred to as the Love Bug or Loveletter, was a computer worm that infected over ten million Windows personal computers on and after 5 May 2000 by Onel de Guzman. It started spreading as an email message with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and the attachment "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs". At the time, Windows computers often hid the latter file extension ("VBS", a type of interpreted file) by default because it is an extension for a file type that Windows knows, leading unwitting users to think it was a normal text file. Opening the attachment activates the Visual Basic script.</p>
                <p>The outbreak was estimated to have caused US$5.5–8.7 billion in damages worldwide and estimated to cost US$10–15 billion to remove the worm. Within ten days, over fifty million infections had been reported, and it is estimated that 10% of Internet-connected computers in the world had been affected. Damage cited was mostly the time and effort spent getting rid of the infection and recovering files from backups. At the time, it was one of the world's most destructive computer-related disasters ever.</p></p>

            <div class="blog-text">
                <h2>SQL Slammer (2003)</h2>
                  <p>SQL Slammer is a 2003 computer worm that caused a denial of service on some Internet hosts and dramatically slowed general Internet traffic. It also crashed routers around the world, causing even more slowdowns. It spread rapidly, infecting most of its 75,000 victims within 10 minutes.
The program exploited a buffer overflow bug in Microsoft's SQL Server and Desktop Engine database products. Although the MS02-039 (CVE-2002-0649) patch had been released six months earlier, many organizations had not yet applied it.</p>
<p>
The worm was based on proof of concept code demonstrated at the Black Hat Briefings by David Litchfield, who had initially discovered the buffer overflow vulnerability that the worm exploited.It is a small piece of code that does little other than generate random IP addresses and send itself out to those addresses. If a selected address happens to belong to a host that is running an unpatched copy of Microsoft SQL Server Resolution Service listening on UDP port 1434, the host immediately becomes infected and begins spraying the Internet with more copies of the worm program.

                <h2>Conficker (2008)</h2>
                    <p>Conficker, also known as Downup, Downadup and Kido, is a computer worm targeting the Microsoft Windows operating system that was first detected in November 2008. The creators of the Conficker virus are unknown. The virus was discovered in 2008 and targeted Microsoft Windows operating systems. It was considered a hybrid epidemic because it used three different methods to spread: local probing, neighborhood probing, and global probing. 
It uses flaws in Windows OS software (MS08-067 / CVE-2008-4250) and dictionary attacks on administrator passwords to propagate while forming a botnet, and has been unusually difficult to counter because of its combined use of many advanced malware techniques.The Conficker worm infected millions of computers including government, business and home computers in over 190 countries, making it the largest known computer worm infection since the 2003 SQL Slammer worm.</p.
<p>
The Conficker virus was difficult to eradicate because it used a combination of advanced malware techniques that were already known to researchers. The virus's creators are believed to have tracked anti-malware efforts and released new variants to close vulnerabilities.

                <h2>Change Healthcare Ransomware Attack (2024)</h2>
                 <p>Ransomware attacks on healthcare organizations have become increasingly common and devastating. One notable example is the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare in February 2024, which affected over 100 million individuals and caused widespread disruption across the U.S. healthcare sector. The attackers, identified as the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group, exploited vulnerabilities in Change Healthcare's systems to gain access and encrypt sensitive data, including personal health information, diagnoses, and financial details. The attack forced Change Healthcare to take its systems offline, leading to significant operational challenges for healthcare providers who relied on their services for managing patient payments and insurance claims</p>
<p>The impact of such attacks extends beyond financial losses and operational disruptions. They pose serious risks to patient care, as healthcare providers lose access to critical systems and data. For example, during the Change Healthcare attack, many healthcare facilities faced difficulties in electronically filling prescriptions and processing insurance claims, which delayed patient care and treatment. The incident highlighted the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures in the healthcare sector to protect sensitive data and ensure the continuity of essential services</p>
